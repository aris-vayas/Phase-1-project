Favorite Anime Collection 

As [a user], I want to search by the name of the anime that I watched. I want to see the title, image, and #episodes,scores and rating of the anime when searching. I also want to add the date, title of the anime, who you watched it with, to my list. I want to like saved collections even after refreshing.
